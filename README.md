# HA Lovelace Dashboard UI for my deployment

This is just the best way to share my lovelace-ui-dashboard for those who liked it. This way they can take a sneak pic of how I did it.

This is WIP.

## The cards I use

First we need to thank all of those who make HA and kept it free for all of us to use! Second, we need to give props to those who developed the cards I use. They are the ones we need to thank for keeping HA always looking good and working. HACS is a real community!
